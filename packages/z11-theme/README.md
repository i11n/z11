## Creating a theme

The simplest way to create a theme is to use the theme generator, which accepts a background color, a text color, a primary and an accent color. Theme theme generator does some calculations to check for accessibility. These few colors are then used to create teh rest of the theme slots.

You can also hand-craft a theme to get more control over theme slots, by starting out with a generated theme and changing the individual slots you want. This gives you control over things like component radius, vertical rhythm, font selections, and so on.
